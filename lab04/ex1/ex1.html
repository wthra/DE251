 You can also override some of the styles that come by default, or create
new ones. These extensions should go in a separate files to make sure we don't
lose them if we update the boostrap version in the future. Note: Boostrap also
offers the "source code" in *less* to facilitate extensions, but that's outside
the scope of this course.
